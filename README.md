# Motion_Parallax

Motion parallax is effect of objects further away appearing to move slower than objects closer to a viewpoint moving at high speed. This effect can be observed by looking out the window of a moving car, which is what this simulation aims to model. 

As you move the mouse, the view point shifts, with objects in the foreground (tree, field) moving more than the objects in the background (mountains, sun) as a function of the input movement.
